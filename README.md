# Project: Fire Agents
## Students:  Alexander Booher, Charles Habermehl

## Introduction
This program runs the "Fire Agent" simulation, where a fire starts on a node in a directed graph
and spreads throughout it.

- A single agent is created at the start and navigates toward nodes that are close to catching fire.
- It clones itself to all neighbors once it reaches a node.
- As the fire spreads, agents keep cloning themselves to try and surround the fire
- The simulation runs until the fire eventually spreads to the base station and destroys it.

## Contributions
- Charles worked on the front-end
- Alex Worked on the backend.
